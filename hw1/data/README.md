you are provided with two datasets (reviews.json and business.json) extracted from
the Yelp dataset for developing your assignment.

1 You can access and download the datasets from the
“data” folder on Google Drive. We generated these datasets in a random sampling way. These given
datasets are only for your testing. During the grading period, we will use different sampled subsets of
the Yelp datasets.
